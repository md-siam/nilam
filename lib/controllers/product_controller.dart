        "Looking to sell my 2009 Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. I’ve owned it since April, however I'm looking to move onto something else (I change cars about every 6-10 months). It’s always been a bucket list car for me so it’s been a pleasure to own and enjoy. The car is in superb condition, I would say 9/10 interior and 9/10 exterior, which for a 12 year old car is great. The entire car has IGL ceramic coating, including the leather interior. The car has never had any paintwork. Additionally, when I bought the car it had the original clear bra so I had it stripped off, the paint corrected from swirls and scratches, and then new llumar clear bra applied to the entire front end of the car. The paint is absolutely amazing on this car, especially in the Arizona sun…the three stage pearl Giallo Midas is one of the best colors for a supercar. The wheels and tires are basically brand new, with less than 1,000 miles on them. I had a couple door dings removed, so there are zero dings on the car. I also had the rear grill of the car powdercoated satin black because the factory finish is notorious for getting sun dyed and gives the car a much cleaner look. There are two chips on the hood, one that is beneath the clear bra (that had penetrated the old clear bra) and one I just noticed today that penetrated the new clear bra. There is a little bit of curb rash underneath the front fascia which are super common for this car but you can’t see them unless you are under the car. The seats only have minor bolster wear and there is no leather stretching on the dash or door panels like you see on most Gallardo interiors.",
